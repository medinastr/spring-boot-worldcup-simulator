# World Cup nations

World Cup repository is a personal project to practice my REST API skills.

The World cup currently contains Nation, Player and Stadium, but I will create and develop more entities to simulate a real soccer championship like Game, GamePayment, Goal, Referee, etc.

### What I practice in this API:
- Request and responses using ResponseEntity
- Status codes and verbs
- Parameters
- API documentation using Swagger
- Database migrations using Flyway
- Tables relationships (one to one, one to many, many to many, etc)
- Exceptions using HandleException / ControllerAdvice
- Value Object / DTO mapping using Dozer
- HATEOAS implementation
- Content Negotiation (JSON and XML)
- Repository / Service / RestController pattern
