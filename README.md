### World cup nations

World cup nations are just to practice what I learn at begin of study spring boot

Here, the user can write the names of 4 nations, which will be saved in a database with 4 attributes:
1. nation_name -> the nation name that user writed
2. wins
3. goals
4. goals_conceded

The attributes wins, goals, and goals_conceded will be automatically saved with a value of 0, assuming that the tournament has not started yet.
