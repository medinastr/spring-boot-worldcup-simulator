### World cup nations

World cup nations are just to practice what I learn at begin of study spring boot

Here, the user can write the names of 4 nations:

![front](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad88b9cd-329f-4fec-a95d-10d9610116fe)

They will be saved in a database with 5 attributes:
1. id
2. nation_name -> the nation name that user writed
3. wins
4. goals
5. goals_conceded

The attributes wins, goals, and goals_conceded will be automatically saved with a value of 0, assuming that the tournament has not started yet.
